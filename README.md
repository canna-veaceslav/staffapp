# staffapp
Thsis is an application for staff that should help to account any stuff from the office. 
I chose a project "StaffApp" to develop an application  because:
- I believe that it can bring practical assistance to the administrative staff of ISD SRL.
- I find this application convenient for the employees themselves to know who and where has a workplace, in case you need to find someone in the office, especially for new employees.
- The application will be useful in that you can find out which item belongs to which employee, tie and untie items from the employee.
- The application will allow you to carry out work on search, binding, and other operations by scanning barcodes, which should make it easier for administrative staff.
- The application can be useful to our partners and not only.
