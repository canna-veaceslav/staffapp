## Why staffapp?

Thsis is an application for staff that should help to account any stuff from the office. 
I chose a project "StaffApp" to develop an application  because:
- I believe that it can bring practical assistance to the administrative staff of ISD SRL.
- I find this application convenient for the employees themselves to know who and where has a workplace, in case you need to find someone in the office, especially for new employees.
- The application will be useful in that you can find out which item belongs to which employee, tie and untie items from the employee.
- The application will allow you to carry out work on search, binding, and other operations by scanning barcodes, which should make it easier for administrative staff.
- The application can be useful to our partners and not only.


## The program consists of:

## web module:

   - a planogram reflecting the layout of the ISD office.
   - displaying occupied and free desks in green and red.
   - the ability to click on the table to see who is sitting at it and what items are assigned to the employee.
   - reports that allow you to see what item is listed for whom, or what is listed for which employee. Or how many free tables, chairs, laptops are in the office.

## mobile app:

   - should allow you to select an employee from the list and see what items are listed for him (laptop, chair, monitor ...).
   - should allow you to bind items to new employees, or replace existing ones by entering a barcode or choosing item from the list;
   - should allow for an inventory of items.


## IoT:

   - the ability to use a mobile application at data collection terminals (RF Terminals) for scanning barcodes
